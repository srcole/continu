# ContinU
### Continuous user authentication using keystroke biometrics
### Insight data science fellowship project, February 2019

This code repository contains scripts and notebooks used in my project to train a gradient boosting model to authenticate users based on their unique keystroke patterns.

#### dashapp/
Files necessary to deploy the Continu security dashboard. This dashboard visualizes the authentication results of the most recent session for a selection of users, as seen at http://www.continu.site/.

The database (`continu_dash.db`) is not provided but can be generated by running the lightgbm notebook followed by the script `create_db.py`.

#### notebooks/
Notebooks for visualizing the data in a few ways, as well as training and evaluating the gradient boosting model.

#### processed_data/
This directory locally contains processed data files. Note it is empty in the public repository.

#### data_raw/
This directory locally contains raw data files. Note it is empty in the public repository.

#### models/
This directory locally contains saved trained models. Note it is empty in the public repository.
